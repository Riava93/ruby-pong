Pong table game requires a few different classes.

Table Class
	This class is the "world" object in this case. It's going to represent the playing field for the game to take place.
	The will require some sort of divider in the middle and dimensions for the paddles.

Paddle Class
	This class is the "player" object in this case. It's going to represent the players 'paddle' when the game initiates.

Enemy Padde Sub Class
	this class is the "ai" object in this case. It's going to represent the enemy ai that the player will compete against.

Ping Pong Ball class
	This class is the 'ball' object in this case. It's going to represent the ball that the player / ai needs to deflect back towards the other.

Score class
	This class is the 'recorder' object in this case. It's going to record the score of both the player and the ai to determine when one or the other has one the game.


The game is probably going to start by button press. Once that is done, the up and down arrow keys or the 'w' and 's' keys will control the players paddle. The AI paddle with attempt to bring it's y position to equal the y position of the ball, however it will move at a slower pace than the ball does, so that the player has a chance to win. If the ball reaches the furthest left x coordinate, then the AI gains 1 point. If the ball reaches the furthest right x coordinate, then the player gains a point.
